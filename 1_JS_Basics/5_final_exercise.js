////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Welcome to the 5th exercise sheet of Programming Fundamentals in JavaScript!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Here we try to put things together and we learn about a new thing:
// recursion.

// EXERCISE 1. Fibonacci.
/////////////////////////

// The Fibonacci sequence is such that each number is the sum of
// the two preceding ones in the sequence, starting from 0 and 1.
// You can learn more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

// a. Implement a function that computes the fibonacci number for
// any input number. For instance, if input is 10, the result is 55.
// Motivational Hint: This exercise is often asked at job interviews.
function fibonacci(number) {
    let ergebnis = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
        ergebnis = ergebnis + i;
    }
    console.log(ergebnis)
}

fibonacci(1);

// EXERCISE 2. Bonus. Recursive Fibonacci.
//////////////////////////////////////////

// Recursion is a computer programming technique in which a function invokes
// itslef inside its body. It's like playing with fire. It can be luring and
// and elegant (specially if you work in a circus), but also very dangerous.
// Your code could get stuck in an infinite loop of function calls which
// ultimately will crash your program.

// Here is an example of simple, but not so useful, recursive function
// that counts until 5 and then returns

function recursive(number = 5, stopCondition = 0) {
    // Stopping-rule.
    if (stopCondition === number) return stopCondition;
    console.log('Counting...' + (stopCondition+1));
    // Self-invocation with increment of the stopping condition.
    return recursive(number, ++stopCondition);
}
resultOfRecursion = recursive(5);
console.log(resultOfRecursion);

// Cool! But what happens if you change ++stopCondition into stopCondition++?
// You can try it, but make sure you save all your open files, because
// you will get stuck in an infinite loop.
// Small changes can cause big problems.

// Now write the fibonacci recursive function.
// Hint: it takes just 2 lines (but you could make it one).
